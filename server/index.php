  <strong>April 13th 2024</strong><br /><span class="style9">
    Added a serverside notification system to the client.<br />
    Currently, this is used to notify clients of available updates.<br />
    But it might be used for other important system notifications.<br />
    Needless to say, if you played the game, please update your versions now :)</span><br /><br />

  <strong>April 13th 2024</strong><br /><span class="style9">
    Fixed the Script Library and DSMail.<br />
    This concludes work on the API and client (for now)<br />
    Just need to update the wiki now...</span><br /><br />

  <strong>April 11th 2024</strong><br /><span class="style9">
    I am now at a point where I think I am fully happy with where the client is.<br />
    Only need to fix DSMail and the Script Library<br />
    Then on to update the documentation on the wiki</span><br /><br />

  <strong>March 22nd 2024</strong><br /><span class="style9">
    Completely redid the DSO scripting engine. It now uses (the safe subset of) VBScript.<br />
    There is also a parser to turn "CLI-like" language into VBScript for you.<br />
    More news soon!</span><br /><br />

  <strong>March 19th 2024</strong><br /><span class="style9">
    Most of the things should now be fixed up. Server scripts and domain filesystem commands fully work.<br />
    The big areas that still need fixing are (all server-only fixes) <i>transactions</i>, <i>DSMail</i> and <i>the library</i>
    (likely in the order I will fix them)</span><br /><br />

  <strong>March 17th 2024</strong><br /><span class="style9">
    Decoded to work on the Wiki today. The Wiki link up top now links to this server, no longer to archive.org.<br />
    I have restored all archived pages to their original state and fixed some typos.</span><br /><br />

  <strong>March 17th 2024</strong><br /><span class="style9">
    Managed to recover at least the startup script files from the leftover "zlog.dat" file.<br />
    Seems to have been a console log, sadly all it ever logged was the startup script.<br />
    The two big things that still need to be restored for basic functionality are as follows:
    <b>Domain filesystem (SERVER WRITE, etc)</b> and some <b>built-in commands</b> (the ones written in
    DScript)</span><br /><br />

  <strong>March 16th 2024</strong><br /><span class="style9">
    Worked on and off on the source of both server and client over the past few days.<br />
    Things are starting to come together. The client is possibly fully ready.<br />
    The server side functions related to domains are mostly in working order once again.<br />
    Sadly, the domain filesystem part needs a lot of attention, but it should be doable!</span><br /><br />

  <strong>March 9th 2024</strong><br /><span class="style9">
    Currently working on restoring the old source code.<br />
    The copy I got (linked below) is of the latest in-dev code
    base, which had several unifnished changes, so I am
    finishing those up.<br />
    The basic game is mostly able to run again.<br />
    Currently fixing the server-side up to be secure for
    today's standards...
    <br />If anyone can find an old copy of DSO, feel free to
    send it over for archival as well.<br />
    You can also watch my work (almost) live on

    Hello again, I did not expect to have to post an update so
    soon, however there is some good news!<br />
    Thanks to my old friend Saberuneko, who I was surprised to
    learn happened to hold onto a copy of the client and
    server source code,<br />
    I now have the mentioned code in my hands. I will try to
    get it compiled and running again, no new features or
    anything, just like it used to be.<br />
    For anyone curious, you can download the code here:

    Hey everyone,

    here. I used to work on DSO way back when and just
    realized the domain was free so I grabbed it.<br />
    No idea what I will do with it, but better than some
    parking company having it.<br />
    If anyone finds versions of the client or other DSO
    related things, please let me know. I would love to have
    them for the archive.<br />
